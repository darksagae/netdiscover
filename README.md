# netdiscover
`Netdiscover` is a tool used in Kali Linux for network discovery. It helps identify live hosts on a network by sending ARP requests and listening for responses. This is useful for finding devices on a local area network (LAN) without needing to know their IP addresses beforehand.

### How to Use Netdiscover

1. **Install Netdiscover** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install netdiscover
   ```

2. **Run Netdiscover**:
   You can run `netdiscover` with various options. Here are some common ways to use it:

   - **Basic Usage**:
     ```bash
     sudo netdiscover
     ```
     This command will automatically scan the network and display live hosts.

   - **Specify a Network Range**:
     If you know the network range you want to scan, you can specify it:
     ```bash
     sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24
     ```
     Replace `192.168.1.0/24` with your target subnet.

   - **Use the Passive Mode**:
     To run in passive mode and listen for ARP requests without sending any:
     ```bash
     sudo netdiscover -p
     ```

   - **Verbose Output**:
     To get more detailed output:
     ```bash
     sudo netdiscover -v
     ```

### Example

Assuming your local network is `192.168.1.0/24`, you can run:

```bash
sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24
```

### Example Output

You might see output like this:

```
Currently scanning: 192.168.1.0/24   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts
2 Captured ARP Req/Rep packets, from 2 hosts.   Total size: 120
____________________________________________________________________
   IP            At MAC Address     Count     Len  MAC Vendor
---------------------------------------------------------------------
192.168.1.1     00:11:22:33:44:55      1      60   Vendor A
192.168.1.10    00:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE      1      60   Vendor B
```

### Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to scan the network.
- Use `netdiscover` responsibly and ethically, as unauthorized scanning can violate network policies.

Netdiscover is a network discovery tool that can be used in Kali Linux to find active devices on a network. Here's how to use it and an example:

1. **Install Netdiscover**:
   Netdiscover is usually included in the default Kali Linux installation, but if not, you can install it using the following command:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install netdiscover
   ```

2. **Run Netdiscover**:
   To run Netdiscover, open a terminal and type the following command:
   ```
   sudo netdiscover
   ```
   This will start the tool and it will begin scanning the network for active devices.

3. **Understand the Output**:
   Netdiscover will display the following information for each active device it finds:
   - IP address
   - MAC address
   - Vendor (manufacturer of the device)
   - Number of hops (the number of network devices the packet has to pass through to reach the destination)

4. **Customize the Scan**:
   You can customize the scan by using various options and flags. Here are some common ones:
   - `-i <interface>`: Specify the network interface to use for the scan (e.g., `-i eth0`)
   - `-r <range>`: Specify the IP address range to scan (e.g., `-r 192.168.1.1-192.168.1.254`)
   - `-R`: Perform a reverse DNS lookup on the discovered IP addresses
   - `-s <seconds>`: Set the scan interval in seconds (default is 3 seconds)

**Example Usage**:
Let's say you want to scan the network with the IP address range `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.254` and perform a reverse DNS lookup on the discovered IP addresses. You would use the following command:

```
sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.1.1-192.168.1.254 -R
```

This will start the Netdiscover tool and scan the specified IP address range, displaying the discovered devices along with their reverse DNS names (if available).

Netdiscover is a useful tool for network reconnaissance, as it can help you identify active devices on a network and gather information about them. This information can be valuable during penetration testing or network troubleshooting activities.

Netdiscover is a network reconnaissance tool pre-installed on Kali Linux used to discover hosts on a network by sending ARP requests. It can be used to identify IP addresses and MAC addresses of devices, and can operate in both active and passive modes.

Here's how to use it:

**1. Basic Usage**

*   Open a terminal in Kali Linux.
*   Type `netdiscover` and press Enter. This will start scanning your network for active hosts.

**2. Key Options and Examples**

*   `-i <device>`:  Specify the network interface to use (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`).  Use `ip a` to view available interfaces.
    *   Example: `netdiscover -i eth0`
*   `-r <range>`: Define a specific IP range to scan.
    *   Example: `netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24`
*   `-p`:  Passive mode. Netdiscover will only listen for ARP requests and won't send any packets.
    *   Example: `netdiscover -i eth0 -p`
*   `-f`:  Fast mode scanning.
*   `-h`: Displays the help menu with available options.

**3. How it Works**

*   **Active Mode:** (default) sends ARP requests to discover hosts. Because ICMP (Ping packets) can be blocked by firewalls, ARP requests are more efficient because they cannot be blocked.
*   **Passive Mode:** It sniffs the network for ARP requests.

**4. Wardriving**

*   Netdiscover was initially developed for discovering wireless networks without DHCP servers, which is useful in wardriving scenarios.

`netdiscover` is a powerful tool in Kali Linux that allows you to discover hosts and networks on a network segment. It's a great tool for network reconnaissance and can be used to identify active hosts, IP addresses, MAC addresses, and even open ports. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use `netdiscover` and an example:

**Basic Usage:**

1. Open a terminal in Kali Linux and type `netdiscover` to launch the tool.
2. By default, `netdiscover` will scan the entire subnet of the interface you are currently connected to. If you want to scan a specific IP range or network, you can specify it as an argument. For example, `netdiscover -i eth0 -r 192.168.1.0/24` will scan the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet using the eth0 interface.

**Options:**

Here are some common options you can use with `netdiscover`:

* `-i <interface>`: Specify the network interface to use for the scan (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`, etc.).
* `-r <IP range>`: Specify the IP range or network to scan (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`, `10.0.0.0/8`, etc.).
* `-d <delay>`: Set the delay between probes in seconds (default is 1 second).
* `-p <port>`: Specify a single port to scan (e.g., `80` for HTTP, `22` for SSH, etc.).
* `-P <port range>`: Specify a port range to scan (e.g., `1-100`).
* `-n`: Perform a fast scan (fewer probes, faster results).
* `-v`: Increase verbosity (more detailed output).

**Example:**

Let's say you want to scan the `192.168.1.0/24` subnet using the `eth0` interface and discover active hosts, IP addresses, and open ports. Here's an example command:
```
netdiscover -i eth0 -r 192.168.1.0/24 -p 22,80,443
```
This command will scan the `192.168.1.0/24` subnet using the `eth0` interface and look for active hosts with open ports `22` (SSH), `80` (HTTP), and `443` (HTTPS). The output will show you the IP addresses, MAC addresses, and open ports of any hosts discovered.

**Output Example:**

Here's a sample output from the previous command:
```
IP            At MAC Address     Count  Len   MAC Vendor
----------------------------------------------------------------
192.168.1.1   00:11:22:33:44:55  2    60   Cisco Systems
  TCP 22
192.168.1.10  00:22:33:44:55:66  2    60   Intel Corporation
  TCP 80
  TCP 443
192.168.1.20  00:33:44:55:66:77  2    60   Dell Inc.
  TCP 22
  TCP 80
```
In this example, `netdiscover` discovered three active hosts on the subnet:

* `192.168.1.1` has an open SSH port (22) and is manufactured by Cisco Systems.
* `192.168.1.10` has open HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) ports and is manufactured by Intel Corporation.
* `192.168.1.20` has open SSH (22) and HTTP (80) ports and is manufactured by Dell Inc.

Remember to use `netdiscover` responsibly and only scan networks and hosts that you have permission to access.
